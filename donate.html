        <p>Martinez-born Joe DiMaggio was one of the finest players ever to play the game of baseball and we need to do more to recognize his accomplishments locally. The Joltin Joe &mdash; a 22-foot Chris Craft pleasure boat presented to him on “Joe DiMaggio Day” in 1949 has now been fully restored to its pristine, original condition through the efforts of volunteers, fundraising, and the generosity of donations such as yours.</p>
        <p>The Joe DiMaggio Hometown Hero Project is completely staffed by volunteer Officers and support workers who believe in our mission. This allows for 100% of your donation to go towards current and future initiatives that include the establishment of a Joe DiMaggio Museum, statues, a mural, a walking tour, and an oral history project all to be located here in Martinez.</p>
        <p>Our non-profit 501(c)(3) identification number for your tax records is <strong>47-5034431</strong>.</p>
        <p>On behalf of the Joe DiMaggio Hometown Hero Project, I want to personally thank you for your donation and we look forward to your future support.</p>
        <p>
          Sincerely,<br>
          <strong>Rick Aldridge</strong>, <em>President</em>

          <h3>Joltin' Joe Commemorative Pen</h3>
          <p>The pen offered is part of a limited production run of 56 pens, authorized by the Board of Directors of the Joe DiMaggio Hometown Hero Project, signifying Joe’s still-record game hitting streak set in 1941. The mahogany wood used in this pen was taken from unsalvageable timber of the original Joltin’ Joe during restoration, turned by an accomplished local craftswoman, and fitted with polished gold hardware into this priceless collectible.</p>
          <p>Each pen is laser engraved “Joltin Joe” and “Martinez” as it was on the stern of the original craft. In addition, each pen is sequentially numbered through 56 and accompanied by our Certificate of Authenticity and this history card.</p>
          <p>We hope you’ll treasure this rare keepsake as much as we treasure one of our own &mdash; Joe DiMaggio.</p>
