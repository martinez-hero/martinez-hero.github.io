            <p>Martinez-born Joe DiMaggio was one of the finest players ever to play the game of baseball and we need to do more to recognize his accomplishments locally. The Joltin Joe----a 22-foot Chris Craft pleasure boat presented to him on “Joe DiMaggio Day” in 1949 has now been fully restored to its pristine, original condition through the efforts of volunteers, fundraising, and the generosity of donations such as yours.</p>
            <p>The Joe DiMaggio Hometown Hero Project is completely staffed by volunteer Officers and support workers who believe in our mission. This allows for 100% of your donation to go towards current and future initiatives that include the establishment of a Joe DiMaggio Museum, statues, a mural, a walking tour, and an oral history project all to be located here in Martinez.</p>
            <p>Our non-profit 501(c)(3) identification number for your tax records is <strong>47-5034431</strong>.</p>
