        <p>An element of the Hometown Hero Project (HHP) is to create a mural welcoming travelers to Martinez the birthplace of Joe DiMaggio. A well-known community business, Waters Moving and Storage, has graciously offered their storage facility for the mural. A family owned and operated moving company, Waters has been a fixture in Martinez for over 37 years. Their warehouse is strategically located between the Amtrak rail lines and Interstate 680 leading into Martinez. This 150,000 cubic square foot warehouse, could accommodate a large mural display visible from both routes into the City. Next step for the HHP is to contract with a muralist.</p>
