        <p>Future plans of the Hometown Hero Project include organizing a walking tour of sites with a Joe DiMaggio connection. The tour might begin at the site of the DiMaggio residence near downtown Martinez. There is a mural of Joe downtown as well as the DiMaggio Baseball Complex in the 150 acre Waterfront Park separated from downtown by the rail tracks. The park also home to several other recreational areas including bocce ball courts, a skateboard park, and 1200 seat amphitheater. Nearby is the John Muir Historical site. Muir made his home in Martinez.</p>
        <p>Joe frequented the City later in life and was caught dining with Marilyn Monroe at Amattoâ€™s on Ferry Street. The boat given him by the New York Yankees sat for years in the Martinez Marina. The boat is currently in the final stages of restoration by local volunteers and is the centerpiece of the planned Joe DiMaggio Museum where the tour might culminate. The historic Martinez downtown area provides tour participants several dining options and is home to several interesting antique shops.</p>
